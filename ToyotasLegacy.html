<p class="generations">The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from1978 to 2002. 
The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.The styling
of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider.
Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, 
Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra. Owing to the similarity and
past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, 
second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, 
while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th 
generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.

        The Supra MK4 A80 is a legendary sports car produced by Toyota from 1993 to 2002.
        It is the fourth generation of Toyota's Supra sports car lineup and is considered one of
        the most iconic Japanese sports cars ever made.
        <br>
        It is known for its sleek and stylish design, powerful engines, and
        impressive performance capabilities. It was available in several trim levels and engine options,
        including the naturally aspirated 2JZ-GE engine and the twin-turbocharged 2JZ-GTE engine,
        which produced up to 320 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque.
        <br>
        The MK4 A80 was also notable for its advanced technology, including a sophisticated
        four-wheel independent suspension system, electronic traction control, and an active aerodynamic
        system that could adjust the rear wing for optimal downforce at high speeds.
        <br>
        The car gained even more fame in popular culture thanks to its appearance
        in the 2001 movie "The Fast and the Furious." The car's popularity has continued to grow in the
        years since its production ended, with many enthusiasts modifying and racing the
        Supra MK4 A80 to this day.

        <div class="text-overlay">The anticipation for the new Supra MK5 was met with mixed reactions as enthusiasts 
            awaited its arrival. While some appreciated the collaboration with BMW for cutting-edge technology and design, 
            others were disappointed that it deviated from the legendary 2JZ engine, a hallmark of Supra's identity. 
            The MK5's sleek design, potent turbocharged inline-six engine, and modern features generally received positive feedback. 
            However, the departure from the iconic 2JZ engine left a void for hardcore Supra fans, marking the end of an era 
            with the discontinuation of the legendary powerplant. Overall, opinions on the new Supra MK5 were diverse, reflecting 
            the challenge of meeting the high expectations set by its predecessor.</div>
